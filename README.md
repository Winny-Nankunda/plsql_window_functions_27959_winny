Business Problem
The company lacks clear visibility into which products and customers generate the most value from its sales data.
Without this insight, it is difficult to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and overall sales performance.

Success Criteria
The project is successful if it accurately identifies top-performing products, valuable customers, and sales trends using SQL analytics.
Results should support data-driven decisions that improve sales growth and customer targeting.

Database Design
The database is structured into Customers, Products, and Orders tables linked by primary and foreign keys.
This design ensures efficient data storage, accurate relationships, and reliable sales analysis.

SQL Analysis
SQL window functions and aggregations are used to rank products, track sales trends, and segment customers.
These analyses uncover performance patterns and support informed business decision-making.

Key Insight
Sales performance is driven by a small group of top products and high-value customers identified through ranking and segmentation.
Tracking monthly trends and growth patterns enables timely decisions that improve revenue and customer retention. 

Conclusion
The project successfully converts sales data into clear insights on products, customers, and trends.
These insights enable smarter, data-driven decisions that support business growth and efficiency.
